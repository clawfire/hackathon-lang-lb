1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,460
Then I quickly think back

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,020
to the conclusion of the previous one, just like, how is it going now?

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,640
We are together today to launch the beginning of the

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,460
consultation period, where we say there

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,540
people have a month to send us their

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,920
feedback, I'm going to be serious about people Robon, how is that

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,820
can be done, I had talked before about the climate platform

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,780
where the organized civil society draft is represented,

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,740
they said it would take three months

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,580
of course, the question could be a little faster, but we still have more time for

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,520
the valuable conclusions that you send to us

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,460
and also to add to the draft

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,280
plan that we have already submitted, which means that we want to

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,880
reach the Commission at the end of June and they

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,620
look at it and give us feedback again and then

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,880
there will be a legislative cycle, an iterative cycle from

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,200
2024 onwards in its

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,800
final form should be sent to the Commission

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,140
that means these are the next important stages, that one takes it here

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,620
really seriously and we would be very happy if we really

21
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,220
get recommendations and further feedback,

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,820
because it is really not our plan that the plan

23
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,320
I say from Luxembourg, to get it done today,

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,500
is an invitation to shape the climate

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,600
neutrality, for the future, that's why it is

26
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,640
important that we take the time here, we

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,960
then the Cuercouode, which should now be

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,960
available over it and then there will be

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,440
additional to the document which now has three hundred pages

30
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,000
normally when there are two hundred and seventy

31
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,060
measures, there is still a synthesis document in three different languages where

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,060
people might be able to read in a more condensed phase

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,060
from the main content can read

34
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,960
and then I think the main elements can be sent to us

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,480
your feedback first but also via the

36
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,740
party of public inquiries, the national

37
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,700
party, where of course we are happy about all the feedback we get about it

38
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,600
and then of course also via mail and that's why the address

39
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,560
is given in Uchnecke, because it is not a final person

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,500
that a draft of various measures and future actions will be even more

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,380
clearly illuminated but it is now the moment we would like to

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,600
build in the feedback there, that's why it's a very important

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,420
stage. Thank you for listening.
